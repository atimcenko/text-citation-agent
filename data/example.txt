Neural state space diagrams can, in principle, have as many axes as there are recorded neurons. In practice, neural activity typically varies along a much smaller set of directionsâ€”dimensions. Because neurons are correlated, each one does not contribute independently to the population signal; instead, combinations of neurons account for most of the variability. This redundancy allows us to apply dimensionality reduction to project the original, neuron-dimensional space onto a smaller set of axes. One common choice for these axes is principal component analysis (PCA).
