The main advantages of using a single‑cell receptive field or tuning curve approach are its simplicity and interpretability. However, it has clear limitations in real‑world scenarios. First, hand‑crafting visual stimuli ignores the statistical structure of natural scenes, which rarely consist of simple features and instead exhibit rich spatio‑temporal correlations across scales. Second, focusing on single‑neuron responses discards the information embedded in interactions within the neural population. For example, the information‑theoretic optimal code in the retina exploits noise correlations between retinal ganglion cells when encoding natural stimuli, producing population receptive fields that differ substantially from the canonical center‑surround shapes. Moreover, many neural systems exhibit mixed and context‑dependent selectivity, which can be easily overlooked when only a narrow subspace of a single neuron’s possible coding directions is explored
